QUERY 3 ðŸ”Ž : What are the most in-demand skills for Data Analysts
    looking for remote jobs?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- Slightly the same as the previous query just that we are filtering out
    non-remote jobs. âœ…
- We want to see what skills to focus on in order to get our remote Data Analyst role. ðŸŽ¯

INSIGHTS ðŸ’¡ :
-------------
- The most in-demand skills for Data Analysts are:
    - SQL
    - Excel
    - Python
    - Tableau
    - R

- The proportion is the same when we only considered remote Data Analyst jobs.
    Of course, the jobs are less, but the proportion remains the same.

- We can still see that SQL is highly-sought after.
    Then, Excel, Python, and Tableau are also skills that are desired.

- Once again, it's definitely recommended on getting comfortable with SQL!
