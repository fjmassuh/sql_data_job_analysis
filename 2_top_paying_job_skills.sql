INSIGHTS ðŸ’¡ :
-------------
- The top 5 most sought-after data skills are:
    - SQL
    - Excel
    - Python
    - Tableau
    - R
- SQL is a must-have skill as it provides the means to manipulate, store, and transform data.
    Clearly, the first skill any Data Analyst should feel comfortable in is SQL. Excel, Python, and Tableau are
    also important skills to have, but SQL is definitely a priority ðŸš¨.
