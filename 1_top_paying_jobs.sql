INSIGHTS üí° :
-------------
- In 2023, the highest paying salaries for Data Analysts ranged from $375K to $650K. Because these are
    high-paying salaries, these roles are most-likely Senior Data Analyst roles (e.g Sr Data Analyst). 
    An entry-level data analyst role would hold a salary significantly less than that of a Senior Data Analyst's.

- The companies that offer these opportunities are:
    1. Mantys
    2. –õ–ê–ù–ò–¢
    3. Illuminate Mission Solutions
    4. Illuminate Mission Solutions
    5. Torc Robotics
